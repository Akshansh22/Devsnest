It added to redis in version 5.0 to solve the issue of history in redis. PUB-SUB do not store the history but stream does and it is scalable.

/ XADD

XADD [stream-name] [key] [field1] [value1] [field2] [value2] .....
XADD [stream] [*(for automatic key generation)] ....

XADD [stream] MAXLEN [Length] * [field] [value] --> defines a size of stream

/ XREAD

XREAD STREAMS [stream] [start-key] --> displays all the entries from the start key.
XREAD COUNT [length] STREAMS [stream] [start-key] --> displays [length] rows from the start key.

XREAD BLOCK [time] STREAMS [stream] [start-key] --> blocks the connection after [time] ,if it receives any entry it displays the entries.

XREAD BLOCK 0 STREAMS [stream] [start-key] --> it does not block the stream indefinitely.

XREAD BLOCK 10000 STREAMS [stream] $ --> shows in realtime the entries and blocks after 10000msec.


/ XRANGE

XRANGE [stream] [start] [end] --> displays all entries between start and end inclusive.
XRANGE [stream] [start] [end] COUNT [number] --> displays [number] all entries between start and end inclusive.

XRANGE [stream] - + --> displays all the entries in the stream.
XRANGE [stream] - + COUNT 10 --> displays the first 10 entries from the start of the table.


XREVRANGE [stream] + - --> displays all the entries in reverse order ie from last to first.
XREVRANGE [stream] + - COUNT 10 --> displays last 10 entries in the reverse order.
